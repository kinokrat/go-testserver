    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!'<br>
    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'<br>
    Merely this and nothing more.
